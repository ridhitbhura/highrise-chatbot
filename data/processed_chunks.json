It's easy for the room owner and moderators to start the party under the \"People in Room\" menu. Just part with 200 gold for an hour of voice chat magic. Don't worry, if an hour isn't enough, you can always extend the fun. A couple of pop-ups will pop up when you start. One is just checking if we can use your microphone (you know, for the voice part of Voice Chat). If you accidentally hit \"deny\", you'll need to pop into your device's settings to allow access. Once you've got the Voice Chat up and running, you can mute your mic with a tap if you need a moment of silence. As the room owner or moderator, you also get the power to invite anyone in the room to join the voice chat. Don't worry, they'll get a friendly pop-up invite to join the chat.

Report the Room's Voice: If there's something not quite right, you can send a report to the person who started the voice chat. End Voice: Only the room owner or moderator can use this to end the voice chat. Wondering why Voice Chat costs gold? It's not just to fill our coffers! The partner we're working with to provide Voice Chat charges us a pretty penny. The gold fee helps us cover some of those costs.

It's like a reality show, but way more interesting! \u200b Turning on Spectating is as simple as flicking a light switch. Just stroll over to your Room Settings. Remember, only the Room Owner has the power to turn on or off the Spectating spotlight. Let's show the world how it's done! So, you're curious about this Spectating mode, huh? Think of it as your personal TV channel - when your room is bursting at the seams, any newcomers transform into spectators, silently watching the magic unfold. \u200b Finding out who's watching is easy peasy! Just pop into the \"People in Room\" tab, and you'll see a list of spectators and active visitors",

They can't: Stroll around or be seen in the room (it's a no-ghost zone!) Join in the text chat or Voice Chat If a spot opens up, all the spectators will get an invite to join the room.

As long as the room owner has enabled the Spectating feature and the room is filled to the brim, you can slip into spectator mode - no mingling necessary! Worried about a crowd? Don't be! Your room is a theater, and there's no limit on ticket sales. Pack in as many spectators as you like, the more, the merrier! Now, let's chat about the law of the land. In the wild world of spectating, rules are the same for everyone. Just like any other visitor, Spectators can be kicked, banned, and reported by room moderators. And yes, you can report someone who's misbehaving, too. It's our collective responsibility to keep this a fun and safe space for all, right? So, let's watch out for each other!",

Create a crew to give your squad some legal (in Highrise) recognition and exclusive perks Crewmates can view one another's activity, create crew-owned rooms (no more adding individual room access rights!), and also become part of a crew-only chat thread. And, you\u2019ll also receive gifts whenever a member makes a purchase. Don\u2019t forget to check in to Highrise frequently, because crew gifts do expire! Depending on the package purchased, you\u2019ll receive a varying amount of gold or bubbles. View your gifts by tapping the \u201cGifts\u201d icon on the right side of your home room screen, or by tabbing over to Gifts on the far right when viewing your crew page. Yippee!",

However, if these 14-days lapse then players will have to pay 10,000 coins if they wish to change their username back. Please note though that the username may be taken by other players once the 14 day period passes so it may no longer be available",

Safety lock allows you to set a 6-digit PIN on your account that prevents anyone who logs into your account on a different device from accessing specific features until they input your 6-digit PIN correctly. The features that are blocked off until your PIN is entered are: Trading Changing your email address Changing your password Connecting accounts (such as Google, Snapchat, etc.) Adding items to a Secondhand Grab machine Changing your username You can access the safety lock and set up your 6-digit PIN via your account\u2019s settings page. Simply tap on the safety lock and enable it, and you\u2019ll then be prompted to select a 6-digit PIN. Please see the images below if you\u2019re having trouble: Nope!

To ensure the safety of our players, we have a host of tools players can use (and some working in the background) to keep them safe from bad actors. This guide will go through those tools and offer some general tips so that you can keep yourself as safe as possible while playing. . We\u2019ve chosen this recommended age because many of our players tend to be on the older side and may discuss topics or use language not suitable for young children. Please note that regardless of your age, sexual content is not allowed on Highrise.

Grab Design Contests: players make a full grab of 12-15 unique items. Graabs are released in major events, and winners will receive the full grab (with their name credited!) alongside a gold prize. Mini Design Contests: players design items or accessories for a grab or shop collection, and also receive name credit, gold, and the items themselves. Art Design Contests: make a card, item, or decoration and have your work added directly to the game! Remember!

There are two ways that we find and feature players\u2019 creations. 1. We frequently host official design competitions; you can learn more in the FAQ under \u201cHighrise Competitions and Rules.\u201d When a player wins a design competition and we make their items in the game, we\u2019ll make an attribution note on the bottom of the item preview. This note will say \u201cInspired by\u201d with a link to the designer\u2019s username. If an item you designed is missing attribution, reach out to our Concierge team to update it. Please include the contest and event the item is from and whether it was released in a grab, shop collection, or event rewards. 2. Sometimes we discover an outstanding player-designed item outside of a competition. It might be a random drawing, or a competition entry didn\u2019t make it into a grab",

If we decide to add one of these items to the game, we\u2019ll reach out to notify the player directly, and they\u2019ll receive compensation when the item is released. These items will also get a note of attribution at the bottom of the item preview. An item will only have an attribution note if it was designed or inspired by a player; all other items are designed by artists on our staff. It\u2019s not unusual for our art team and our players to find inspiration in similar trends and create similar designs independently by complete coincidence- this phenomenon is sometimes called parallel thinking",

Bring a friend (or two) along for the ride, and they can even bring their own furniture too \u2013 once you've given them Design Rights. Here's how to turn room decorating into a party: Pop into Room Settings and give 'Moderation and Access' a tap. Hit 'Add User', and it's search time! Hunt down that friend who's got the design skills of a pro. Now you can both work on making that dream room a reality. They can play interior decorator anytime, changing up your room's look to their heart's content. Just remember, your furniture sticks around until you decide to haul it out, and your friend's furniture stays put until they move it. It's like a sleepover - everyone brings their stuff, but they also take it back home. And while anyone with Design Rights can play musical chairs with the furniture, no one can take anyone else's items. So, let the decorating party begin!",

It's like a \"blink and you'll miss it\" bonus! If your creation held the spotlight for over 3 seconds, you're in for a whopping 3000 GOLD! Talk about a superstar salary!

Here's your step-by-step guide to becoming a pro-tipper: Spot a player you'd like to tip? Just tap on them when you're both hanging out in the same room. This will bring up their mini-profile menu, with options to wave, wink, or heart. But what's that shiny gold coin on the far right? that's the tipping option. Alternatively, you can hit the '+' symbol in a direct message and choose the 'Tip Gold' option. Slide to show your generosity. You can tip gold bar values of 1G, 5G, 10G, 50G, 100G, 500G, 5,000G, or even a whopping 10,000G! Don't have gold bars handy? No worries! You can morph your regular gold into gold bars right there in the tipping system. Just remember, the gold conversion taxman cometh, so a 500G tip, for example, will actually cost you 550G",

    "text": "Craving some free gold? Well, our Cash Shop is the gold mine you're looking for! Just scroll to the bottom, and voila! You can take on sponsor offers for some dazzling free gold. It's like a treasure hunt, but without the need to get your hands dirty! But what if you've completed an offer and your gold is nowhere to be found? Fear not, we've got a map to guide you: See, we at Highrise are great at many things, but handling gold from sponsors isn't our forte. So, you'll need to get in touch with the parent company, like Tapjoy or Fyber (not the game itself, like Mobile Strike). Luckily, you can reach them without leaving Highrise. Here's the secret path: Tap 'shop' (it's hiding in the bottom right-hand corner). At the shop, choose 'cash store'. Now, scroll down to the very bottom where the offerwall partner offers are hanging out. Instead of a price, you'll see a welcoming 'Go'. Hit 'Go' for the provider you used (like hitting the bullseye!)",

If it's Tapjoy, hit the three lines in the top left corner and choose 'Reward Status'. Tap on the offer that's still holding your gold hostage. On the bottom left of this page, there's a 'missing gold' button. Give it a tap. In the bottom left of the next page, you'll find a 'contact support' option. Tap this to send a support ticket to our offer partner. They'll play detective and help you unearth your missing gold. Remember, the 'contact support' option will only appear after 24 hours on an 'in-progress' offer. So give them the lowdown on your gold woes, and they'll be on the case! Happy gold-digging!",

    "text": "Ever wondered why Gold Bars carry a heftier price tag than Gold in Highrise? Well, it's time to spill the secrets: Gold Bars come with a 10% premium, like adding truffle oil to your french fries. So, if you're buying a 500G Gold Bar, it'll cost you 550 Gold from your vault. Why the price hike, you ask? Well... Gold Bars are the social butterflies of our virtual world; they love to be traded! Meanwhile, Gold prefers to stay put, a tad shy about being traded. The extra cost of Gold Bars is like a superhero fighting inflation in Highrise. How? Well, every time a Gold Bar changes hands, it shape-shifts back into Gold, and poof! Gold vanishes from the economy. Fewer Gold floating around means lower prices for items",

The Progress Rewards usually pop up halfway or 3/4 of the way towards the total items needed to snag the grab's Legendary. Take a grab with 16 items, for example. You'd get the Progress Reward after spinning and winning 10 unique items out of 16. This reward doesn't count towards unlocking the Legendary \u2013 it's just a pat on the back for getting closer to your goal!

Some items are rarer, and as such, they hold more value in the marketplace and there are fewer of them in Highrise. Each item falls into one of four categories: Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. This is a measure of an item's rarity and value, with Legendary items being the most rare and valuable. When you spin in the game (which is based on chance), for gold grabs, you'll receive either a \u201crare\u201d item or an \u201cepic\u201d item. Rare items will drop more frequently than Epic items. Once you've spun and received every item in a gold grab, you'll be rewarded with a Legendary item! On the other hand, for bubble grabs, you're more likely to spin a common item than a rare one. However, once you've won all items in a bubble grab, you'll receive the Epic item for the set. Keep in mind that gold grabs expire sooner than bubble grabs",
